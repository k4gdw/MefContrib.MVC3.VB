MefContrib.MVC3.VB
==============

----

This is a simple [NuGet](http://nuget.org) package that installs a
vb.net bootstrapper for Microsoft's [Managed Extensibility
Framework](http://bit.ly/11DdiE2) (MEF) into an VB [Asp.Net
Mvc3](http://www.asp.net/mvc/mvc3) project.

Once i've had time to test it and verify that it actually does what it's supposed to do I'll end up publishing it to the official NuGet Package Source so it'll be widely available to other web developers on the Asp.Net stack.

If you'd like to take a stab at it or have improvement
suggestions, just send me a pull request.  I'm using the git-flow
workflow so you should fork the project, create a feature branch named feature/<your-new-feature> and send me a pull request from that branch.

Note:
------

It would ***probably*** work fine for Mvc4 as well as it follows
the same App_Start convention for such start up code.  YMMV
